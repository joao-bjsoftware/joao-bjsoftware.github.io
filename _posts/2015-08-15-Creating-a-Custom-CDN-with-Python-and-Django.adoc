### What is CDN and why should I serve static files this way?

Hello everyone!

I am Jo√£o Carvalho. How are you? This is my first article in English language, so please, be patient with this Brazilian guy and feel free to report any misunderstood in comments.

After a long time without post anything (I was really very busy with happy coding) I am here to talk about serving files through a CDN (Content Delivery Network) structure with Django Framework.

A CDN is a structured network to serve files in various storage servers. The main advantages to use it is:

- To control the user's storage quota;

- To control the user's bandwidth quota;

- To avoid the users access files directly;

- Allow to revoke access when some signal is triggered;


In the first, you must think if you really need to use it. You should consider a to use a CDN to server files when:

- Your files only can be downloaded with a general link to it

- Your files cannot be accessed by it's direct file URL

- You need to log file's size and download count for bandwidth consumption and disk space usage

- You must restrict those file's access with some particular business rule, for example when the user access expires.

- You have a large number of files and need to allocate on optimized storage servers instead your application server


### Cool, I need it! Let's do this!
