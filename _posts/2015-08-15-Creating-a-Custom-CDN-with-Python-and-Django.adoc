### What is CDN and why should I serve static files this way?

Hello everyone!

I am João Carvalho. How are you? This is my first article in English language, so please, be patient with this Brazilian guy and feel free to report any misunderstood in comments.

After a long time without post anything (I was really very busy with happy coding) I am here to talk about serving files through a CDN (Content Delivery Network) structure with Django Framework.

A CDN is a structured network to serve files in various storage servers. The main advantages to use it is:

- To control the user's storage quota;

- To control the user's bandwidth quota;

- To avoid the users access files directly;

- Grant and revoke access when some signal is triggered;


In the first, you must think if you really need to use it. You should consider a to use a CDN to server files when:

- Your files only can be downloaded with a general link to it

- Your files cannot be accessed by it's direct file URL

- You need to log file's size and download count for bandwidth consumption and disk space usage

- You must restrict those file's access with some particular business rule, for example when the user access expires.

- You have a large number of files and need to allocate they on optimized storage servers instead your application's server one.


### Cool, I need it! Let's do this!

For learning purposes, let's imagine the following fictional scenario. Please, feel free to extends at your needs.

1 - We need to log user file upload statistics (For disk quota);

2 - We need to log user file download statistics (For bandwidth quota);

So Let's do this:

First of all you must add a setting in settings.py file that will be our MEDIA_PRIVATE_ROOT. All private files will be placed here.

```python
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
MEDIA_PRIVATE_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media_private')

```
We will also need a software requirement:

Many people knows that Django Server is not the usual way to serve media and static files. Many Web Servers handle better with in this functionality, so, we will need django-filetransfers package that forces your current Web Server to handle downloads instead your Django application

Basically, using django-filetransfers with the x-sendfile Web Server module a HTTP header will be set to ensure that NGINX or Apache will handle download instead Django Server.


```bash

pip install django-filetransfers

```
Now, we must create two Model Classes to handle with disk usage and bandwidth quota.

```python
# - coding: utf-8 -
from django.db import models

class DiskUsage(models.Model):
    u"""
    
    This class will manage disk usage to 
    check storage quota 

    """
    file_path = models.FilePathField(max_length=255,
                                     db_column='file_path',
                                     null=False, blank=False,
                                     unique=True)

    size = models.DecimalField(db_column='size',
                               null=False, blank=False,
                               max_digits=18,
                               decimal_places=2)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'cdn_disk'


class BandwidthUsage(models.Model):
    u"""

    This class will manage file downloads to 
    check bandwidth quota

    """

    log = models.ForeignKey(DiskUsage, null=False, blank=False,
                            db_column='log_id')

    date = models.DateTimeField(db_column='date', auto_now=True, 
blank=False,
                                null=False)

    size = models.DecimalField(db_column='size',
                               null=False, blank=False,
                               max_digits=18,
                               decimal_places=2,
                               default=0)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'cdn_down'

```

After do it, we'll create the engine of CDN process. Django Framework uses an intermediary class to work with file System. Let's extends *FileSystemStorage* class.

```python
class PrivateStorage(FileSystemStorage):

    def __init__(self, location=None):
        if not location:
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(u"File System location not 
defined")
        FileSystemStorage.__init__(self, location=location)
        #Here you can adjust file permissions for you new files
        self.file_permissions_mode = 0644

    def get_available_name(self, name):
        u"""

        This method will check if a file exists in OS 
        then delete it for "update"

        You can do another behavior here if you 
        don't like this one.
        
        Create a new name then return is a 
        good example for do it

        """
        if self.exists(name):
            self.delete(name)
        return name

    def open(self, name, mode='r'):
        u"""
        
        This method is called every time that someone
        requests to download or use a file
        
        """
        try:
            file = DiskUsage.objects.get(file_path=self.path(name))
        except:
            #If a file disk usage does not 
            #exists there's no file to download
            raise Http404()
        band = BandwidthUsage()
        band.log_id = file.id
        #Date is for query bandwidth per month for example
        band.date = datetime.now()
        band.size = self.size(name)
        band.save()
        return FileSystemStorage.open(self, name, mode)

    def _save(self, name, content):
        u"""
        
        Triggered when someone saves a file to your disk.
        Our intent here is compute the size for log disk usage
        
        """
        path = self.path(name)
        #Our field limitation
        if len(path) > 255:
            raise Exception(u"File path is too big")
        
        #Try to catch an existing file, if something goes
        #wrong, a new one instance is created
        #REMEMBER: According our models file_path is UNIQUE
        try:
            file = DiskUsage.objects.get(file_path=path)
        except:
            file = DiskUsage()

        file.file_path = self.path(name)
        save_name = FileSystemStorage._save(self, name, content)
        file.size = self.size(name)

        file.save()
        return save_name

    def exists(self, name):
        u"""
        
        I extend this method only to demonstrate you
        that you can add custom behaviors here
        
        """
        fExist = os.path.exists(self.path(name))
        return fExist

    def delete(self, name):
        u"""
        
        I extend this method only to demonstrate you
        that you can add custom behaviors here
        
        """
        FileSystemStorage.delete(self, name)

```

Now, to our scenario works properly, we must do two things:

1) Set all desired Model fields to be served in CDN with our custom File System Storage like bellow:
 

```python
fss = PrivateStorage(MEDIA_PRIVATE_ROOT)

def _get_upload_to_files(instance, filename):
    return 'files/{date}/{file}'.format(
        db=instance._state.db, date=instance.date, file=filename)

class ExampleFileModel(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(verbose_name="File to Download",
                            upload_to=_get_upload_to_files,
                            null=True, 
                            blank=True,
                            storage=fss,
                            max_length=255,
                            db_column='file')
```

2) Create a view to handle "ExampleFileModel" private download like bellow:
 

```python
# - coding: utf-8 -
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.http.response import Http404, HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render
from filetransfers.api import serve_file
from app.settings import MEDIA_PRIVATE_ROOT
import os

@login_required
def cdn_download_file(request, id):
    u"""
    This method will handle all private downloads

    """
    try:
        obj = ExampleFileModel(pk=id)
    except:
        raise Http404()

    #We can set here some behavior to check 
    #if user can or cannot download this object

    try:
        return serve_file(request, obj.file)
    except:
        raise Http404()
```
 

### Considerations

With Powerful FileSystemStorage class, implement a CDN is just like implement any Python code, powerful and simple. Do things like restrict access, store files in different storage optimized servers and use load balancing algorithms on save or request files are easy to do. I really hope this article be useful to you, if you will have any doubt or consideration, please do it.


(1) – django-file-transfers application is well documented on https://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-filetransfers

(2) – X-sendfile module must be installed and configured with your web server. The same module is called X-accel on NGINX

(3) – FileSystemStorage is a Django Framework class that handle with: (Guess it?) File system storage.
