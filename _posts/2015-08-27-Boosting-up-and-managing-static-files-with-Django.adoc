### Lights on fire!

I have good news:

*There a cacheable world outside and we can gain some speed improvement with it.* 

With simple settings, you can do it with Django and NGINX Web server and minify static files, save bandwidth and reduce application network loading time;


### What is to minify?

To minify static files is a process based on remove all unnecessary characters including trailing spaces, spaces between commands and source comments. By doing this, you will boost up your page load.

There a lot of software to minify files but the minification process will let static files hard to read and maintain. We don't want it, so to had a better approach in this two worlds you must use Django-pipeline application with some of those compression software.

In this article, I will talk only about Django-pipeline minification behavior with *YUI Compressor*.
